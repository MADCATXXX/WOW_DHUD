-to be added:
-consider adding option for shield displaying from bottom of health as new color
-add command to reset cast duration info (usefull after bosses with time speed change)
-check for item id error during wow start up if item such as back is on cooldown
-check lua startup code for errors and reset it after
-unify target and player auras with cd tracker (separate class)
-calculate damage for soul capacitor trinket and ring (show as stacks, minimizing numbers, e.g. 4k)
-ace3 profiles bugged? check alpha and other settings are correctly changed on profile change
-add option 3 for shields (so that health is always at 100% when health + shield is over 100)
-cooldowns for racial abilities
-refactor "timer" table, add filterData table as last variable (remove timer[filterName] and timer[guiFilterName])
-filterData subtable is map with filterName as a key
-filterData value is another map, e.g. { priority: 0, keepInCombat: true }, this can be extended from dhudsettings table
-allow to exclude pet casted short auras
-retest cooldown tracker with UNIT_INVENTORY_CHANGED event again (based on code from extraCD)
-ring tracker helper, buff applies, but without timer, so we should count 15 second by ourselves (tracker based on Rogue Bandit's Guile)
-options for buffs, change old format to new e.g. {slotID:10}, {id:333, desc:"Touch of Karma", type: 1}, {id:333, glow: 100, keepInCombat: 1}
-allow to diffirientiate short auras from player and pet (rogue shadow form)
-allow dhud settings to use complex buff format instead of id
-add command line option for short auras animation variations
-add higlight graphics from extraCD
-add options for priority buffs in json format
-keep option for cds
-hide healing when at maximum health?
-help for startup lua code, e.g. code to hide raf, or maybe frame with click to add scripts
-conditions for buffs prioritization
-diminishing returns as part of AuraTracker?
-cooldowns for passive items? scan tooltips, but only on item change (updateData still requires to scan but other events not)
-disable mouse over when casting aoe (or make option to disable mouse or enable only with certain key modifiers)?
-other textures support (renetair from DHUD4)
-add option to place cast info under bar
